    <h1 class="title">Welcome to the Web Basics</h1>
    <hr class="separator">
    <p class="paragraph">This is a simple example of styled text using HTML and CSS. You'll find headings, paragraphs,
        and a list below
    </p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It structures the content of the web pages</p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Why learn HTML?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="list__item">It's the foundation of every website</li>
        <li class="list__item">Easy to start and understand</li>
        <li class="list__item">Works with CSS and JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Once you're comfortable with the text elements, you can start adding images, links, and layout
        techniques like
        Flexbox and Grid
    </p>
    <p class="bg__blue">This paragraph has a blue background and a solid left border. It's often used to highlight
        information and notes
    </p>
    <p>This one is italic and has a dash underline. It's good for side comments and quotes</p>
    <p>Here the text us bold and slighty larger with a yellow background and rounded corners</p>
    <p>THIS TEXT IS CENTERED, GREEN, UPPERCASE, AND SPACED OUT -- GOOD FOR EMPHASIS OR HEADINGS INSIDE PARAGRAPHS</p>
    <p>A gradient background with white text and a soft shadow makes this paragraph stand out for special messages.</p>
